In the context of designing a file sharing system akin to Google Drive, consider the following user roles:

User1: File owner with full access.
User2: Possesses read-only permissions for the file.
User3: Lacks access but can solicit access from the owner.
Questions:
Regarding file size constraints (maximum 25MB), would you implement file size validation on the client or
server side? Please elucidate your approach.

In the scenario where User3 seeks access to a file, how would you facilitate notifying the owner of the file
 about this access request? Kindly elaborate on your proposed notification mechanism.
